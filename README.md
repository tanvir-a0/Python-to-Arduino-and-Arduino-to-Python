##Python to Arduino and Arduino to Python
<br>
<br>
<!--
I have searched extensively for a system that simplifies reading and sending data through USB to Arduino but didn't find any. 
So, I have written this code to remember how to do it properly.

Note that in this code, I expect that only one line is sent from the Arduino at a time. 
If there are multiple lines, I add them to a String and output them all at once.

If you find any problems with my code, please let me know and I'll fix them.
